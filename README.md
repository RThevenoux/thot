## Genetic Algorithm Explorer
Explore an genetic algorithm (evolutionary search) by playing with the parameters during a solution landscape search.

### How it works
Type your name (or anything) in the input box, and click 'Evolve Me'. Change parameters on the fly by hitting enter and observe the effects on the algorithm. The top 10 individuals of each generation are displayed along with their respective score (see fitness function).

#### Fitness function
The score of an individual is found by comparing char-by-char the ASCII code values of a string against the target string.

#### Mutation Rate
Chance of mutating any given char during mating.

#### Parents per Child
How many individuals' contribute part of their genome during a single mating event.

#### Population Size
How many individuals are generated at every generational event.

#### Selection Bias
How heavily weighted is the selection process towards the best individuals.

#### Elites
How many of the top individuals are cloned into the next generation.
